# TicTacToeWifi

This is a simple game of tic tac toe that can be multiplayed in LAN, using libGDX and java sockets.

This is in fact my first libGDX game so I am not sure all the techniques I used are the most optimized or recommended however the code works pretty fine for what I expected.

ps: only the game source files are included not the whole project.
